# Overview

This program takes an image that is chroma-keyed green, and superimposes it onto another image.

I wanted to learn more about how to manipulate images and to expand my java experience.

# Development Environment

I used the open version of JDK to write and compile this program. I also used the javax.imageio, java.awt.image, and java.awt.Color libraries.

* [Direct Color Model documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/image/DirectColorModel.html)

# Future Work

* There's a pretty big bug where both images need to have the same dimensions in order for the program to not crash.
